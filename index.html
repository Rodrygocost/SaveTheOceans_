              It's incredible how little we know about our oceans, they contain
              the largest area of ​​biodiversity on the surface of the earth,
              with thousands and thousands of species of life, each of which has
              unique characteristics, from small fishes to large aquatic mammals
              that give us beautiful and exuberant representations of nature in
              its purest form. That is why it is so important to preserve and
              study our oceans correctly, so that future generations can get to
              know this fantastic world, and so that humanity can be able to
              live in harmony with all the species that are present there, as a
              way to gain more and more knowledge about them.

                Previously it was said that our oceans are places full of the
                most varied forms of life, as a consequence of this, humanity
                ended up finding in it a huge source of microorganisms that have
                been able to help us over the years in the most varied ways,
                through biomedicine. For a long time now, humanity has been
                benefiting from the ocean to combat diseases, as well as to
                better understand various aspects of our body, a great example
                of this occurred when the great Covid-19 pandemic ended up
                hitting our world, during this period, some researchers found
                certain substances in various marine beings that could help us
                in this fight.
              </p>
              <p>
                Such as the case of M101 (known as HEMARIN) found in the
                hemoglobin of marine worms, which ended up being used in the
                treatment of people affected by Covid-19, there are many of
                several others examples such as the case of jellyfish that
                taught us about the functioning of our own system of nerves and
                neurons in the past, which only makes us reinforce the fact that
                it is much more useful for us if we take good care of our
                oceans, harvesting a seed that can be harvested well in the
                future.

                To preserve our environment we must take very good care of our
                oceans, not throwing rubbish already helps our planet a lot, as
                rubbish discarded in the ocean can harm marine life, causing an
                accident when digested, making it difficult for animals to move
                around or even leading to his death, we must ensure that no one
                throws garbage and pollutes our oceans, together we can be
                strong and fight against all this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enough of pollution in our seas, stop throwing sewage into our
                oceans, stop throwing plastic objects into our oceans, keep
                ships regulated so they don't spill oil into our oceans.
